# Bookstore, BookWorld 
Module-16-Project 2

## Description
This ‘bookworld’ website allows the user to search information about books. The application displays the book name, the book cover and its price using the user search input. 

The user can also browse for books by genre using the navbar located at the top of the page. Top rated books are also included in the application in addition to the book genres. 

The user can select the books they wish to purchase by select ‘add to cart’ button. 
The checkout cart is located to  the right top corner of the website. When clicked, it takes the user to a new page where the list of the selected books is shown.
